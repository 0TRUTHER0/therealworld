      <h1>How Have I Learnt Linux ?</h1> 
      <h2>First I wanna share why have i learnt linux in the first place...</h2>
      <p>
        Hey everyone, I've been reflecting on why learning Linux and tinkering with it is such a beloved pastime for many. From my own experience, I've found that Linux offers a unique combination of freedom and challenge. Unlike proprietary operating systems, Linux allows users to peek under the hood, tweak settings, and even build their own distributions from scratch. There's a real sense of empowerment that comes with mastering Linux, as it opens up a world of possibilities for customization and optimization. Plus, the vibrant community surrounding Linux means there's always someone to turn to for support or to share in the excitement of discovering something new. Whether it's for personal enjoyment, professional development, or simply the thrill of exploration, diving into Linux is a journey that never fails to captivate and inspire.<br> <br>
